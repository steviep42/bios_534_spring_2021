    "## Compared to R\n",
    "\n",
    "scikit-learn is not really a direct competitor to anything in R, at least in my opinion. R is a statistical framrwork first and formost which means that it has always had many statistical functions, and what we now consider to be Machine Learning methods, readily available. Over time, R has offered packages like [caret](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html), [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/), and [mlr](https://mlr.mlr-org.com/) (now deprecated), which represent either front ends to standalone ML packages or a rewrite of various methods. In this regard, R has had a big head start on Python. Keep in mind that data frames, which are a native object in R, are not native to Python and it was only when the Pandas module was created, that we could get similar capability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, there is a wealth of online support for these various packages which simplifies ML projects in R. There is an excellent book called [Applied Predictive](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/) Modeling which, though it uses the caret pacakge as a default framework, provides a great overview of general considerations relative to Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "All this said, the scikit-learn module leverages the fact that Python was and is an easy-to-use general programming language. This makes Python a great language to develop and deploy models. The scikit-learn module is an attempt at a ground-up framework to provide ML capability. While there have been other such Python implementations, scikit-learn has the current \"mind share\" in this space. In my view, if you are going to do any type of Predictive Modeling or Machine Learning in Python then scikit-learn is the way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "I won't hide my opinion here that I think that R graphics, particularly ggplot2, is superior to Python graphics such as matplotlib and seaborn. (There is a reason that the [plotnine](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-ggplot2-in-python-74ab8adec129) package exists to give ggplot2 capability to Python users). However, if you are going to be working in the Python universe then you should spend time understanding matplotlib and seaborn because much of the documentation and support literature you will encounter will make reference to these frameworks. Also if you have a MATLAB background then you already have some experience with matplotlib. The scikit-learn package has a number of built-in plot types that are peculiar to various algorithms so before you try to produce a plot you might first check to see if something already exists before trying to make your own plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Putting scikit-learn to Work\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s easy to get lost in all that we have been doing up until this point so let’s review what the typical predictive modeling workflow will look like. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Data Import (read in csv files, extractfrom a database, read from internet)\n",
    "   - Do some Data Visualization\n",
    "   - Data Prep (We haven’t done much of this just yet) \n",
    "  \n",
    "       * Find Missing Data and perform imputation \n",
    "       * Scaling \n",
    "       * Create dummy variables\n",
    "       * One hot encoding\n",
    "       * Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Data Splitting (training / test) \n",
    "   - Determine split ratio - K-Fold Cross Validation (repeated)\n",
    "   - Modeling / Prediction\n",
    "   - Evaluation\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Back To The Beginning\n",
    "\n",
    "It is implied that in predictive modeling the ultimate goal is to generate a model that could be reasonably applied to new data. As we have learned, it is best to train any model on a data set that has been (re)sampled in some way (e.g. K Fold CV) which should help provide a more realistic estimate of “out of sample” error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our earliest example we tried to predict the MPG from mtcars using a basic linear modeling function. The caret package provides a uniform way to do this which allows us to easily substitute in alternative functions without having to majorly change our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call the train function in such a way as to pass in any arguments that are specific to a given method though in a way we could do for other methods. We can also tell the train function that we want to evaluate RMSE as a performance measure. That is, it will “know” that our primary performance measure for a model is RMSE. Before we do that, however, we’ll make a test / train pair. One way to do this is write our own functions to sample some proportion of a data frame."

    "So we wrote a function to sample some proportion of a data frame to create a training data set and to also have a test data set comprised of the remaining data. Common training and test proportions include 80 / 20, 70 / 30, and 60 / 40. We didn't really need to write a function as the scikit-learn package has a function that will us do this. We'll also introduce a convention used in Python Machine Learning where we split the label (what is being predicted) into a separate structure. The remaining information represents the predictor variable(s). In the parlance of the Python, we refer to the former as \"y\" (lower case) and the latter as \"X\" (upper case). We do this in large part because there is a helper function called **train_test_split** which expects this format to do its work. "

This helps address situations wherein large variation due to outliers might be present in one fold but not another. the ultimatel goal is to build a model on a number of training data sets with the hopes that we can better predict model performance on unseen data.

One thing that the Machine Learning does when using Python is to separate what is being predicted, in this case the **mpg** variable, from the data being used to make the prediction. One typically uses the nomenclature of **y** (lower case) to refer to the former and **X** (upper case) to refer to the latter. Note that while this isn't strictly necessary, at least as far as I can determine, it is a popular convention. So I'll just rewrite what we have above."

    "One of the more challening things when working with data is that some methods seem to want the input in a certain format. Let's revisit the opening section when we separated the mtcars data into X and y which is the preferred way of indicating what is being used to predict and outcome. In using various scikit functions, I find myself having to reshape the data or turning it into an array to accomodate the input requirements of various functions. In all fairness, I have had to do the same thing when using R so it's not unique to a given language. "
