    "## Predictive / Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In Predictive Learning it is customary to apply methods to build models on existing data to help you\n",
    "\n",
    "    Understand the data at hand and\n",
    "    Build a model to predict outcomes on related information\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, number 2 assumes that what you already know in terms of the data and model is suitable for application to a more general situation when this might not be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you just want to build a model (apply a method) to explain the data at hand as opposed to using it to predict outcomes for incoming data of a related nature. Not all models need to be predictive and in fact it might be useful to first get a basic understanding of the data before attempting to extend it to new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "    “A common misconception in various scientific fields is that predictive power can be inferred from explanatory power. However, the two are different and should be assessed separately.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    — Gamit Shmueli - “To Explain or Predict”\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a data set, there might be some variable therein that you would like to predict in terms of other variables. Ideally you would like to automate this process but not at the expense of understanding the underlying statistical considerations. The process should also be done in a way that allows one to define a specific performance measure / metric that can then be used to compare performance across a number of “models”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative to explanatory work you wish to drill down into the data to better understand it and are less concerned about how any resulting model might apply to unseen or new data. In this case you might not look at other data sets or permutated versions of the data in which case you just build different models against the same data while trying out different features to arrive a the “best” model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In predictive work, we typically use techniques such as cross fold validation and bootstrapping to provide us with different versions of the data to “train” a model after which we validate it on some “test” data that has been held out. So in this context, you will probably be looking at multiple versions of the original data set which adds to the overhead somewhat.\n",

    "### Titanic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of explanatory work is the often referred to “Titanic” data set that has lots of information on the passengers who traveled on the ill-fated Titanic ship. This data set is used in many Data Science type educational contexts to talk about building models."
